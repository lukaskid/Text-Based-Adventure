Name: HoldingCell
Description: You wake up in a dimly lit holding cell. The walls, made of sleek, cold metal, pulse faintly with a soft, reddish glow — an unsettling reminder of the Martian ship you're aboard. The air hums with the faint, rhythmic sound of energy coursing through the vessel. Before you, the cell door is not a solid structure but a shimmering energy barrier projected from energy emitters in the walls, its surface rippling slightly as if alive. It crackles faintly when you approach, warning you not to touch. Beyond the barrier, you catch glimpses of what appears to be a sitting area bathed in pale blue light and a grid of compartments where captives’ belongings might be stored. In the far corner of your cell, one of the floor panels seems slightly misaligned, its edge protruding just enough to catch your eye. The dim lighting makes it hard to see clearly, but it could be something worth investigating.
AlternateDescription: The holding cell feels strangely quiet now, the crackling hum of the energy barrier replaced by a heavy stillness. The walls, once bathed in the eerie red glow of the containment field, now seem dull and lifeless. Scorch marks mar the edges of the doorway, the metal slightly warped from the force of the destruction.

Name: HoldingArea
Description: As you step through the now-flickering energy barrier, a faint static charge tingles against your skin before dissipating. The holding area opens up before you — a stark contrast to the confined cell. The air is cooler here, carrying a faint metallic tang and the low hum of alien machinery. To your side, a semi-circle of alien seating surrounds a low, glowing table. The holographic patterns swirling on its surface shift as you approach, morphing into unfamiliar symbols and abstract shapes. The pale blue lighting casts eerie shadows, making the area feel both serene and unsettling. Directly ahead, a wall of lockers lines the space. Their translucent panels reveal various items within, some ordinary, some alien and unrecognizable. One locker near the middle catches your eye, your bag unmistakably inside. Beyond the table, a door to a hexagonal purple hallway, the walls rippling with a soft, otherworldly glow.

Name: PurpleHallway
Description: The holding area gives way to a hexagonal hallway, its walls shimmering with a strange, iridescent purple hue. The lighting here is dim and uneven, creating shifting shadows that play tricks on your eyes. The smooth, metallic floor hums faintly beneath your feet, vibrating in time with the ship’s ever-present energy. Away from the holding area, the hallway splits in two. One side, an orange-lit corridor stretches ahead, its glow warm but unnatural, the color pulsating like a slow heartbeat. The other, a green hallway looms darker, its light murky and faintly unsettling, casting jagged reflections on the walls. Then you hear it — faint but distinct, footsteps echoing from the green hallway. The sound is deliberate and unhurried, each step sending a chill down your spine. The shadows in the green corridor seem to deepen, as if something or someone is approaching.

Name: OrangeHallway
Description: You step into the orange hallway, the warm, pulsating light wrapping around you like a living presence. The glow is unsettling in its consistency, casting everything in hues of deep amber and rusty gold. The walls are smooth, metallic, and strangely reflective, amplifying the faint hum of the ship’s energy system. The hallway stretches ahead, narrowing as it continues into the distance. A sharp turn reveals another passageway — a red corridor that seems to vibrate with an ominous intensity. At the far end of the orange hallway, the purple hallway beckons you with its eerie, iridescent glow, standing in stark contrast to the warmth of this corridor. But it’s what lies in the center of the orange hallway that draws your attention, a massive, open doorway leading into a hangar bay. The space beyond is vast, filled with shadowed forms and the smell of fuel and metal. You can just make out the silhouettes of ships, some sleek and unfamiliar, others worn and battered from countless journeys .The air heavy with the scent of engine fuel and the faint sound of mechanical whirring.

Name: HangarBay
Description: You enter on an elevated platform, metallic floor beneath your feet. A railing runs along the edge, giving you a clear view of the expansive hangar bay below. The space is vast, its high ceiling lined with crisscrossing pipes and pulsing conduits that emit a faint, rhythmic glow. The air is heavy with the acrid scent of engine grease and ozone, mixed with the faint hum of machinery echoing through the chamber. Scaffolding extends downward in a series of zigzagging staircases and ladders, leading to the main floor below. From your vantage point, you spot a group of Martians scattered across the hangar. Their wiry forms move with mechanical precision, tending to their machinery, inspecting equipment, and loading supplies. Thankfully, they’re too preoccupied with their tasks to notice you — for now. Your heart skips a beat as your eyes land on a familiar silhouette in the center of the bay, your ship. Its worn hull stands out against the sleeker alien vessels surrounding it, a beacon of hope amidst the alien chaos. But hope fades as you notice the massive hangar doors behind it, locked tight with thick beams and a glowing energy field.

The eerie hum of alien technology still pulses through the walls, but the oppressive feeling of confinement is gone. Your ship stands there, its hull worn but solid, a beacon of escape amidst the chaos of unfamiliar vessels.

Name: RedHallway
Description: You step into the red hallway, immediately struck by its oppressive, pulsating glow. The light here is harsh, the walls are a deep, burnished red. The air is heavier here, carrying a faint tang of ozone and something faintly acrid, like burned circuits. Each step you take echoes unnaturally, as if the sound is swallowed and distorted by the oppressive red glow. The hallway stretches in both directions. The orange-lit corridor glows faintly warm, a stark contrast to the unsettling energy of this passage. Ahead, the green hallway emerges from the shadows, its eerie, murky light blending awkwardly with the red, creating an unnatural swirl of colors where the two connect. At the center of the hallway, a large, reinforced door looms, flanked by faintly glowing control panels. A symbol etched into its surface suggests it leads to the barracks. The door hums faintly, sealed tight for now, though the controls beside it seem active, their alien glyphs pulsating faintly in time with the hallway's erratic glow.
AlternateDescription: The red hallway is unrecognizable in the aftermath of the explosion. The warm, pulsating glow that once lit the corridor now flickers erratically, casting jagged shadows along the scorched walls. The metallic floor is littered with debris—shattered panels, fragments of alien machinery, and the faint remnants of smoke swirling in the dim light. The air is thick with the acrid smell of burnt materials and ozone, stinging your throat with every breath. The oppressive hum of the ship’s systems feels heavier now, almost like a growl reverberating through the damaged corridor. The shattered doorway to the barracks gapes open like a wound, revealing only darkness beyond. The Martians’ hurried footsteps and agitated voices echo faintly from within, their attention focused entirely on the chaos inside. The orange-lit corridor glows faintly warm, a stark contrast to the unsettling energy of this passage.

Name: GreenHallway
Description: Stepping into the green hallway, you’re immediately enveloped by its dim, murky light. The green glow is uneven, spilling out from narrow strips along the walls, casting jagged, shifting shadows that make the space feel claustrophobic. The purple hallway glimmers faintly, its iridescent hues fading into the oppressive green. The unsettling red hallway looms, its harsh light casting an eerie interplay of colors where it meets the green glow. At the center of the green hallway, a heavy door stands tall and unyielding. Its surface is smooth and featureless, except for a glowing panel to the side. You quickly realize this must be the control room—a critical location if you’re to unlock the hangar doors. But the panel blinks insistently, its symbols suggesting a code is required to gain entry. Directly across from the control room door, another hallway branches off, its yellow light spilling faintly into the green corridor. The glow is warmer but no less strange. The faint hum of the ship’s energy is more erratic here, and each step you take seems amplified, echoing faintly down the branching paths. The locked door to the control room taunts you, a barrier between you and escape.

Name: YellowHallway
Description: The yellow hallway, the warm, golden light washing over you like sunlight filtered through a haze. The glow is gentle but disorienting, casting soft, elongated shadows that seem to shift with your every movement. The air here is slightly warmer, with the faintest hint of something sweet and metallic in its scent. The yellow corridor branches off from the green hallway, you can still see the murky green glow of the passage, contrasting sharply with the cheery hue. Three doors line this hallway, each marked by an odd, pulsating symbol. On one side, the first door slides open with a faint hiss, revealing a storage room. Shelves line the walls, filled with crates and containers of all sizes, some stacked haphazardly, others carefully organized. The room smells of old supplies and unused equipment, with the faintest trace of something organic lurking in the back corners. Across from it, a second door leads to an armory. The room beyond is lined with racks of weapons entirely alien. At the far end of the hallway, a final door stands—this one leading to the cockpit. But as you approach, you immediately sense that something is off. The door is sealed tight, its metal surface cold and immovable. There’s no sign of how to open it, and any attempts to force it are met with resistance.

Name: Armory
Description: The armory’s door hisses open, revealing a room that feels both orderly and unsettling. Racks of weapons line the walls, their designs unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Sleek, alien constructs hum faintly with latent energy, their surfaces etched with glowing symbols and flowing patterns. Some resemble rifles or blasters, while others are completely unrecognizable—bizarre shapes and configurations that defy earthly logic. Amid the strange and foreign arsenal, something familiar catches your eye, a bomb. Its simple, rugged design stands out sharply against the alien backdrop. Attached to it, a detonator, a compact, handheld device.

Name: StorageRoom
Description: The storage room is cramped, filled with the clutter of everyday ship operations. The air here is thick with the scent of old supplies and musty metal, a mixture of things long stored away and things left in haste. Shelves line the walls, packed with crates, equipment, and scattered parts—everything from tools to unopened containers, each marked with alien symbols. Some items appear well-maintained, others worn or half-forgotten. A few crates are stacked high in the back, the edges of some peeling away from years of disuse. There’s a faint and occasional metallic clang echoes from elsewhere in the ship. You can tell this space has been frequented—some crates are neatly stacked, others hastily pushed aside as if someone was in a hurry. A few items lie discarded on the floor, while others are partially opened, revealing their contents: strange mechanical parts, some familiar, others entirely alien. In the far corner, an old cart loaded with boxes creaks under its weight, some items slipping off onto the ground. Your attention is drawn to a partially opened crate near the middle of the room. It looks as though it’s been disturbed recently—the lid crooked, some of the contents spilling out. Pushing aside a few items, you uncover a small, metal box hidden beneath. Its surface is scratched and worn, and it looks like it’s been buried in the clutter for a long time. Inside, a data pad lies on its side. Its screen flickers to life as you touch it, revealing a set of unfamiliar symbols and a string of numbers. There’s no immediate explanation of what it’s for, but the sequence seems deliberate, important. You make out 4 numbers 1 9 8 6.

Name: ControlRoom
Description: The control room door slides open with a faint hiss, revealing a compact but meticulously designed space. The air here is cooler, and the low hum of machinery fills the room. Panels of glowing screens and alien interfaces line the walls, casting shifting lights that pulse with a rhythmic, almost hypnotic pattern. At the center of the room, a raised console stands as the obvious focal point. Its surface is sleek, with holographic displays flickering above it. Strange symbols and diagrams scroll across the screens, but one central display catches your eye — a schematic of the hangar bay doors, outlined in vivid blue. Clusters of alien glyphs flash across the panel, accompanied by faint, melodic chimes. The interface seems intuitive but foreign, as though it was designed to be operated quickly but only by those familiar with it. A prominent control slider glows faintly, its position clearly indicating the hangar doors are currently locked.

Name: Ship
Description: 
AlternateDescription: The boarding ramp extends with a soft hiss, inviting you inside. The air within is cool and carries the faint, metallic scent of home. As you step through the threshold, the gentle hum of the ship’s systems welcomes you, and the dim cabin lights flicker on, casting a warm glow across the interior. Every detail is exactly as you remember — the scuffed floor panels, the patched-up seat cushions, the console that has seen you through countless takeoffs and landings. But you can't take off without the keys in your bag and if the hangar bay doors are closed.
